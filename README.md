## Bookmarklets

### Twitter
These bookmarklets allow you to hide mentions and retweets on the web interface.  
When viewing a new user profile, I want to see non-reply tweets only. These are what I'd receive if I were to follow them.

[Hide Retweets](http://raw.github.com/n8kowald/bookmarklets/master/twitter/hide-retweets.js)  
[Hide Mentions and RTs](http://raw.github.com/n8kowald/bookmarklets/master/twitter/hide-mentions-and-retweets.js)  

Used Ben Alman's great [jQuery bookmarklets generator](http://benalman.com/code/test/jquery-run-code-bookmarklet/) for these.
